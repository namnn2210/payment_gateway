# Payment Gateway Project Summary

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive payment processing system built with Django that integrates with multiple Vietnamese banks and provides automatic and manual payment processing capabilities. It handles payment transactions, user management, payout operations, and settlement processing.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Django 5.0.6
- **API Layer**: Django REST Framework
- **Database**: 
  - MySQL for primary storage
  - MongoDB for transaction history
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis
- **Authentication**: Two-factor authentication

### Core Modules

#### 1. Payment Processing
The central module for handling payment transactions including:
- Transaction validation
- Payment status tracking
- Bank integration
- Payment verification

#### 2. Payout System
Manages user payouts with these key features:
- Automatic and manual withdrawals
- Timeline-based scheduling
- Status tracking and notifications
- Integration with multiple bank APIs

#### 3. Bank Integrations
Supports multiple Vietnamese banks including:
- ACB
- MB (Military Bank)
- VietinBank
- TechcomBank
- MBDN (MB Digital)

Each bank integration follows a standardized interface while handling bank-specific API requirements.

#### 4. User Management
- Role-based access control
- Two-factor authentication
- Session management
- Activity logging

#### 5. Settlement Processing
Handles settlement of transactions between parties:
- Settlement verification
- Status tracking
- Automated notifications

## Database Design

The system uses a dual-database approach:
- **MySQL**: For core application data (users, payouts, configuration)
- **MongoDB**: For high-volume transaction data

This architecture allows for efficient handling of different data types and scales.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-time Transaction Processing
- Webhook endpoints for receiving transaction notifications
- Automated payment status updates
- Real-time validation

### 2. Security Features
- Two-factor authentication
- Session management
- Encrypted credentials

### 3. Notification System
- Telegram integration for alerts
- Email notifications
- In-app notifications

### 4. Reporting and Analytics
- Transaction summaries
- Payment status reports
- User activity tracking

### 5. Bank API Integrations
- Standardized interface for multiple banks
- Balance checking
- Internal and external transfers
- Transaction history retrieval

## Recent Refactoring

The codebase has undergone significant refactoring to improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and enhance performance:

### 1. Service Layer Implementation
Extracted business logic from views into dedicated service classes:
- `PayoutService` for payout operations
- `DatabaseService` for database operations
- Improved error handling and consistent return patterns

### 2. Database Abstraction
Created a unified database interface that delegates to either MongoDB or MySQL based on configuration:
- Dynamic provider selection
- Consistent API for both implementations
- Configurable via environment variables

### 3. Code Organization
- Separated constants and configuration values
- Created modular structure for bank integrations
- Implemented proper typing and documentation

### 4. Bank Integration Standardization
Developed base classes for bank integrations:
- Abstract methods for consistent interfaces
- Shared utility functions
- Standardized error handling

### 5. Improved Error Handling
- Consistent try-except patterns
- Proper error messages and status codes
- Exception logging without operation failure

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment with:
- Environment-based configuration
- Docker containerization support
- Jenkins integration for CI/CD

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for continued enhancement:
- Further API standardization
- Enhanced monitoring and metrics
- Performance optimization for high-volume transactions
- Additional bank integrations
- Expanded reporting capabilities
