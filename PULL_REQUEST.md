# Refactor to Controller-Service-Repository Architecture

## Overview

This pull request introduces a substantial architectural refactoring of the Payment Gateway system, adopting the Controller-Service-Repository (CSR) pattern to improve separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability of the codebase.

## Changes

- **Implemented a three-tier architecture:**
  - **Repository Layer**: Handles all database operations and data access
  - **Service Layer**: Encapsulates business logic and validation
  - **Controller Layer**: Manages HTTP request/response handling

- **Refactored modules:**
  - **Bank Module**: Complete refactoring of Bank and BankAccount entities
  - **Payout Module**: Complete refactoring of Payout entity

- **Added comprehensive documentation:**
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Details the new architecture, patterns, and benefits

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a well-defined responsibility
- **Improved Testability**: Layers can be tested in isolation with proper mocking
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't require changes in others
- **Better Code Organization**: Clear directory structure with logical separation
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports future growth and potential microservices decomposition

## Implementation Details

- Repositories encapsulate all database queries, making database changes easier to manage
- Services implement business logic, validation, and orchestrate repository calls
- Controllers are thin and focused only on HTTP concerns and mapping to services
- Added proper error handling and consistent response formats

## Test Strategy

The new architecture makes testing significantly easier:

1. Repository tests focus on database interactions
2. Service tests mock repositories to test business logic in isolation
3. Controller tests mock services to test HTTP handling

## Future Work

- Refactor remaining modules to follow the same pattern
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Implement a proper dependency injection system
